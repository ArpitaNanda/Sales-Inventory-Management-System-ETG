# Sales-Inventory-Management-System-ETG
This respository contains all python codes with json files for making Sales Inventory Management System during my ETG AI/ML Internship.

This Python based project provides the user to add, display, remove, search, and update the products. It also allows customers to purchase the product and generates the bill after purchase.
Software used: Jupyter Notebook

## This Inventory Management System is working on No SQL based database:
Used 2 JSON files to store data.
(i)product.json is used for data on products.
(ii)sales.json is used for data on purchase details.

### There are 5 attributes per product:
1) Product ID
2) Product Name
3) Product Type
4) Product Price
5) Product Quantity

### There are 5 attributes per purchase:
1) Billing ID
2) Product ID
3) Product Name
4) Product Quantity Bought
5) Total Amount

#### My project can do the following things:
1) Add products to the inventory.
2) Display products stored in the inventory.
3) Remove products from the inventory.
4) Search products from the inventory.
5) Update products to the inventory.
6) Purchase product for customers.
