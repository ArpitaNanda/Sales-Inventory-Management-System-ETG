# Sales-Inventory-Management-System-ETG
This respository contains all python codes with json files for making Sales Inventory Management System during my ETG AI/ML Internship.

This Python based project provides the user to add, display, remove, search, and update the products. It also allows customers to purchase the product and generates the bill after purchase.
Software used: Jupyter Notebook

## This Inventory Management System is working on No SQL based database:
Used 2 JSON files to store data.
(i)product.json is used for data on products.

### There are 5 attributes per product:
Product ID
Product Name
